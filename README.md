# Prediction-of-Maternal-Health-Risk-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-

The main goal of this study is to utilize various machine learning methods, including **K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and XGBoost** to classify maternal health parameters and predict the risk levels for expectant mothers. By employing machine learning techniques, it becomes possible to effectively forecast maternal health risks. The research involved implementing multiple data preparation strategies such as standardization and encoding categorical data. These techniques and algorithms were executed using the Python programming language with machine learning libraries. The study obtained prediction results and assessed algorithm performance measures, which were then visualized for comparison and discussion.
